        <h1> FREE SCHOOL DINNERS </h1>
        <h1> FOR EVERY CHILD </h1>
        <p> When children eat well, their health and educational outcomes improve. 
            Food eaten during the school day makes up around 17% of the average 4-10-year oldâ€™s daily meal consumption. 
            Therefore, ensuring the food children eat at school is healthy and nutritious is critical.
            Making school meals free for all primary children in England could play an important role in decreasing 
            obesity prevalence and closing the educational attainment gap in the UK.
